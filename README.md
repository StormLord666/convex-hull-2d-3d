## Convex Hull 3D
implements the Randomise Incemental Algorighm
### Tasks to be done
- [ ] Finish commenting on the code (also understanting)
- [ ] Insert the number of the points to randomly create as a parameter
- [ ] Try to make it a bit more personal (maybe remake?)
- [ ] Generalize it to implement 2D and run each CH according to the parameter
- [ ] Implement DCEL (not sure if can be done)
